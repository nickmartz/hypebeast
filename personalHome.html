                <p class="lead">James Jebbia, the founder of Supreme and crowned Menswear Designer of the Year at the 2018 CFDA Awards, opened Supreme in 1994 with the intention of creating a less commercialized and a more laid-back clothing shop. Since Jebbia was a huge fan of the skate community, he often employed local young-skateboarders to work at the shop on Lafayette street (NYC), not too far away from the downtown art district. Initially, Supreme only sold a few T-shirts before coming out with a cotton hoodie made with premium materials. This instantly gained success and interest of many, including Notorious B.I.G who repped the brand religiously. Not too long after, many other celebrities starter to become familiar with the brand and started to wear it. From this point on, Supreme was never the same. As time passed on, Supreme became harder and harder to obtain and is now seen as one of the most iconic and demanded brands. Supreme has collaborated with many artists/brands/companies including Louis Vuitton, Campbell's (yes, the chicken noodle soup company), Rolex, Vans, Nike, Coleman, and many more. Depending on the season of the year, you can find weekly drops of <a href="https://www.supremenewyork.com/">Supreme</a> on their website but they usually sell out within seconds. Realistically, you can cop Supreme on many secondary markets but, beware, it usually comes with a hefty price tag. </p>

                <p class="lead">Nigo, the founder of A Bathing Ape (Bape) and currently the creative director of Uniqlo's UT division, grew up in the Hip-Hop scene in Japan. In his early years, he attended Bunka Fashion College and spent his night life in clubs DJing and making connections. These two experiences led him to meet Hiroshi Fujiwara and Jun Takahashi. Fujiwara helped the two create Nowhere.Co, a fashion boutique that sold select brands. At this time in 1993, <a href="https://us.bape.com/">Bape</a> was created. Nigo decided to create Bape with the itention of catering to "the few, not the many" and by 1998, the demand for it become globally apparent and this is when Nigo realized he created something bigger than he imagined. Bape remained relevant over the next couple of decades, however, recently, Bape has encountered finanacial problems and Nigo stepped down as creative director. Nigo continues to remain in the fashion world, working closely with Pharrell Williams and on private projects. It is safe to say that without the influence of Bape, many of today's streetwear brands would not have been created.</p>

                <p class="lead">Shawn Stussy, the founder of <a href="https://www.stussy.com/">Stussy</a>, grew up in the West-Coast surf culture and in his early life, was a skillful surfboard shaper. Shawn started to attend trade shows to sell surfboards with his signiture of "Stussy" scribbled on them. He decided to print the same signture on some black Hanes T-shirts and possibly sell it with the boards. Within three days, Shawn sold a thousand of them. Taking matters into his own hands, in 1980, Shawn decided to launch Stussy (clothing) and fund it himself. He created Stussy and adopted the hip-hop-esque because it was "effortlessly cool". Stussy, without any explanation besides the enticing signiture, went on to be a multi-million dollar company. Shawn states that Stussy has "become something that he was never looking for and with that comes a lot of responsibility, twenty-four hour workdays and all the money in the world. But, if you don't have time to go spend it, what good does it do?". In 1996, Shawn left the brand and moved to Hawaii to spend time with his family. In 2008, Shawn was rumored to come back into the clothing business. Eventually in 2010, he launched <a href="http://www.s-double.com/">S/Double</a>, a clothing company with a mature/surf influence. Today, Shawn Stussy and S/Double remain low-key and seperated from the corporate world.
